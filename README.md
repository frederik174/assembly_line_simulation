**Assembly Line Simulation**

This model simulates the movement of vehicle within the assembly of the T6 (Baseline & Multivan) in the Volkswagen plant in Hannover. Simulated RFID gates, mobile Beacons and MES create [EPCIS-Events](https://www.gs1-germany.de/gs1-standards/datenaustausch/epcis/) which are fed into an [Apache Kafka Cluster](https://kafka.apache.org/).
